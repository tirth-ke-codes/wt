		The Chinese garden <b>is a landscape garden</b> style which has evolved over three thousand years. It
		includes both the vast gardens of <del>the</del> <em>Chinese emperors and members of the imperial family,
		</em> built for pleasure and to impress, and the more <b>intimate</b> gardens created by scholars, poets,
		former government <small>officials</small>, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from
		the outside world. <big>They create an idealized miniature landscape,</big> which is meant to express
		he harmony that should exist between man and nature.
		A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and <i>includes one or more ponds</i>, rock works, trees and
		flowers, and an <sup>assortment</sup> of halls and <font color="#ff0000">pavilions within the garden
		</font>, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure,
		<strike>visitors can view a series</strike> of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of
		<sub>landscape <sub>paintings.</sub></sub>
