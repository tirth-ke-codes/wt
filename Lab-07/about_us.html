        <font size="8">T</font>he first restaurant proprietor is believed to have been one A. Boulanger, a soup vendor, who opened his
            business in Paris in 1765. The sign above his door advertised restoratives, or restaurants, referring to the
            soups and broths available within. The institution took its name from that sign, and restaurant now denotes
            a public eating place in English, French, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Romanian, and many other languages, with

            French aphorist and gastronomic chronicler Jean-Athelme Brillat-Savarin, a frequent guest, credited
