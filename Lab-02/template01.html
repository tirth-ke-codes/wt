			The Chinese garden <b>is a landscape garden</b> style which has evolved over three thousand years. It
			includes both the vast gardens of <del>the</del> <em>Chinese emperors and members of the imperial family,
			</em> built for pleasure and to impress, and the more <b>intimate</b> gardens created by scholars, poets,
			former government <small>officials</small>, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from
			the outside world. <big>They create an idealized miniature landscape,</big> which is meant to express
			he harmony that should exist between man and nature.
			A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and <i>includes one or more ponds</i>, rock works, trees and
			flowers, and an <sup>assortment</sup> of halls and <font color="#ff0000">pavilions within the garden
			</font>, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure,
			<strike>visitors can view a series</strike> of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of
			<sub>landscape <sub>paintings.</sub></sub>

		Chinese garden  IS THE BEST <font size=20><b>to visit</b></font>
